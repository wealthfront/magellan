# Magellan

<img src="assets/magellan_icon_web_hi_res_512.png" width="200" align="right" />

A simple, flexible, and practical navigation framework for Android.

> Note: This library is currently under development for the next major version.

## Why would I use Magellan?

- **Simple**: Intuitive abstractions and encapsulation make it easy to reason through code.
- **Flexible**: The infinitely-nestable structure allows for many different styles of structuring an app and navigating between pages.
- **Practical**: We pay special attention to simplifying common patterns and removing day-to-day boilerplate.
- **Testable**: Plain objects that are easy to instantiate make testing simple.
